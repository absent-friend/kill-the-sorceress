# Kill the Sorceress!

This is a web adaptation of Jeremy Thompson's advanced tutorial for the first Sorceress fight in Spyro: Year of the Dragon. [Check out the original document.](https://pastebin.com/Z8hncDwM)

The pastebin is a very valuable and well-written source of information, but it's a little unfriendly, since there are a number of supplementary images and videos that can't be 
embedded in a plain text document. My aim with this project is to take advantage of modern web conveniences to present this tutorial in a more unified and accessible manner.

## Technical details

This project uses:
* [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/) as a component-building + reactivity framework.
* [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.
* [Vike](https://vike.dev/) with the [`vike-solid`](https://vike.dev/vike-solid) extension for routing and static site generation.
